# There is padding created through separator_block_width despite separator being turned off. If separator was set to true
# then it would be space on the sides the separator.
separator=false

# No border, dealing with margin through separator_block_width and in sway bar config through
# height/status_padding and status_edge_padding
# This would be useful if you would like to have a transparent bar with
# individual blocks having their background and padding (via border=[hex color]) of the same
# colors as the background in the pango markup output of the blocklet, and use the border
# as a fuax padding and margin with separator_block_width.
#border=00ffff
#border_top=3
#border_right=3
#border_bottom=3
#border_left=3
#min_width=50

# Needed even for just proper rendering of icons.

# Example of formatted markup example to be used inside blocks:
# <span background="#000000" foreground="#ff00ff">Text</span>
